The new CosmoHub portal is built on top of Apache Hive, part of Apache Hadoop

Now you can create, analyze and download your own custom catalogs through a
guided process without any knowledge of SQL language, and blazingly fast!</p>

<p>If you use any data obtained through CosmoHub in your research, remember to read
the data distribution rights from the corresponding catalog and also the
CosmoHub citation guide.</p>
