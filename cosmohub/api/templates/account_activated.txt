Hi {{ user.name }},

Congratulations, you are now a member of the CosmoHub community!
We are thrilled that you have joined us!

We hope this will help you in your scientific research because CosmoHub is
better than ever!
The new CosmoHub portal is built on top of Apache Hive, part of Apache Hadoop
ecosystem, which provides SQL access to massive datasets.
Now you can create, analyze and download your own custom catalogs through a
guided process without any knowledge of SQL language, and blazingly fast!

If you use any data obtained through CosmoHub in your research, remember to read
the data distribution rights from the corresponding catalog and also the
CosmoHub citation guide.

For any doubts or suggestions, reach us at cosmohub@pic.es.

Cheers,
The CosmoHub team.
